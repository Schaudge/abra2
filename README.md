# ABRA2

ABRA2 is an updated implementation of ABRA (https://github.com/mozack/abra) featuring:
* RNA support (coming soon)
* Improved scalability (Human whole genomes now supported)
* Improved accuracy
* Improved stability and usability (BWA is no longer required to run ABRA although we do recommend BWA as the initial aligner for DNA)

The software is currently considered alpha quality.  Please tread lightly.
